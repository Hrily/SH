##Installation
###Building From Source
The source is presented as an Android Studio project, which means it's simple to modify and/or build the source code yourself! To get started, [download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads). If you need help with the installation process, watch the provided [setup guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html). Once you've done that, follow the steps below:

1. Download the project by clicking the green **Clone or download** button above the list of files. If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can automatically clone the project by selecting **Open in Desktop**. Otherwise, choose **Download ZIP** and extract the contents to a folder of your choice once it has finished downloading.
1. Open Android Studio. Click **Open an existing Android Studio project** and select the folder you saved the project to.
1. Android Studio may warn you about out-of-date Gradle versions, missing Build-tools, etc. Just select the **Fix** option whenever possible and the project should eventually be error-free.
1. To test the app, press the green **Run** arrow at the top of the screen. A dialog will appear asking you to choose a device. You may choose to use a physical device connected to the computer or an Android Virtual Device (AVD). See [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#createavd) for instructions on setting up an AVD.
